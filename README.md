ShadowTreasure is my final submission for SWEN20003 Object Oriented Software Development Porject-2. 

The project is a implementation of the game ShadowTreasure where the player automatically  enters a tomb to search for a treasure box. The tomb is lled
with zombies, that the player needs to fight before reaching the treasure. While the fighting is
energy-consuming, the tomb is also filled with the nutritious foods to let the player regain strength.
